## From Idea to Action

When the pandemic disrupted my robotics activities, I found myself searching for a meaningful way to contribute to my community. With limited resources and an at-risk family member at home, I began brainstorming ways to engage students like me in meaningful service opportunities. The result was **Portland Student Pandemic Response (PSPR)**, a nonprofit organization connecting high school students with communities in need during the pandemic.

Initially, PSPR was a website cataloging service opportunities, allowing students to filter options based on hours, costs, and interests. The response was overwhelming—our site received over **24,000 hits**, was used in local school curriculums, and even featured on the news. As interest grew, PSPR expanded into a larger nonprofit with virtual collaboration spaces for students to develop impactful service projects, targeting the challenges posed by the pandemic.

Our story was featured in [Portland Monthly](https://www.pdxmonthly.com/news-and-city-life/2021/04/what-is-portland-student-community-response-nonprofit), which highlighted our mission and the impact we made in Portland communities.

## Projects and Programs

### Summer Action Team

To foster community connection in a safe, virtual format, I worked with our board to launch the **Summer Action Team**. Over two summers, students joined cohorts to create projects supporting specific groups impacted by COVID-19. These efforts produced virtual and local events, awareness campaigns, and more. Together, participants contributed over **4,000 hours** of service.

### Student Impact Projects

As director of our after-school program during the 2020-2021 school year, I helped students propose and develop their own community service initiatives. We hosted **12 team projects**, addressing issues like houselessness, mental health, and educational support. I provided resources, connections, and guidance to bring these ideas to life.

### Vaccine Finder Textline

In Spring 2021, I helped program PSPR’s **Vaccine Finder Textline**, a tool to locate vaccine appointments by zip code. Built using an open-source API and enhanced with machine learning, the tool became a vital resource during a time when vaccine slots were scarce. It was used over **409,000 times** and received positive feedback for its efficiency and accessibility.

## Leadership in Action

Founding PSPR required a balance of technical skills, strategic planning, and community engagement. I built the initial website, assembled a student board of directors, and worked alongside a leadership team to create impactful programs that involved nearly **100 local students** and countless others through our service projects. Together, we turned ideas into action, transforming student passion into meaningful community impact.
