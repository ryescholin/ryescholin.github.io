HyperXite is a student-led engineering team from UC Irvine, where members collaborate across disciplines to innovate in the field of transportation and engineering. The team focuses on designing and building advanced systems, with a commitment to fostering hands-on learning and technical excellence.

After two years of experience with HyperXite, I was elected to lead our 35-member team spanning ten subteams, overseeing project management and team operations. As Project Manager, I coordinated leadership efforts, team goals, and deliverables while fostering a collaborative and engaging team environment.

## Leading the Management Team

I worked with three other management team members to define the team’s vision, set goals, and implement strategies. Weekly management meetings were a cornerstone of this effort, where I helped guide discussions, reviewed progress, and addressed challenges across subteams.

My responsibilities included:

- Setting clear agendas for meetings and ensuring actionable takeaways for all attendees.
- Establishing a shared calendar with critical deadlines for deliverables, events, and safety compliance.
- Coordinating with management peers to align priorities and delegate tasks efficiently.

I also focused on fostering collaboration within the management team, emphasizing open communication and shared accountability.

## Organizing the Team and Deliverables

My work involved leading weekly management and general meetings, setting agendas, tracking timelines, and ensuring team-wide alignment with project goals. I introduced standardized guides for key processes, including funding proposals, safety training, and reporting. These documents streamlined assignments across subteams and ensured efficient team operations.

## Prioritizing Safety

Ensuring team safety and regulatory compliance was a central part of my responsibilities. I collaborated with Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) to address safety violations identified during inspections and worked with team members to complete required training.

I also overhauled our lab’s safety documentation, including:

- Updating and reorganizing safety binders with signed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for machinery and chemicals.
- Implementing lock-out/tag-out procedures to enhance equipment safety.
- Conducting reviews and walkthroughs with lab managers and inspectors to verify compliance.

These efforts not only ensured a safe workspace but also reinforced a culture of accountability and attention to detail across the team.

## Recruitment

Along with the rest of management, I spearheaded our recruitment period, welcoming new members to HyperXite. This process included:

- Hosting information sessions to introduce prospective members to our team.
- Developing and implementing an algorithm to sort and evaluate applications efficiently.
- Leading 53 interviews to identify talent across multiple disciplines.

## Budgeting and Funding Management

Financial planning was a key component of my role. I developed subteam-specific budgets based on projected expenses and tracked spending to ensure financial accountability. I coordinated with the rest of management to understand their needs, creating a consolidated budget that reflected both short-term and long-term objectives.

I also spearheaded outreach to sponsors, both continuing and new, crafting tailored sponsorship pitches that aligned with each organization’s interests and priorities. This included highlighting the impact of their support on advancing innovative student engineering projects. Additionally, I explored creative fundraising methods, such as launching a ZotFunder campaign and engaging the university’s engineering council for additional funding avenues.

These efforts ensured that the team remained financially stable and well-resourced to achieve its goals.
