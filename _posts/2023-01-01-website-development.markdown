During my internship at Smilefish, I developed websites with React and earned AWS certifications, both of which helped me expand my technical skill set.

### Starting out in React

I built a strong foundation in React through a Udemy course, mastering concepts like JSX, state management, props, and component composition, which I applied to developing scalable and efficient features for the SeaNet project.

### SeaNet: A Hands-On Development Experience

At Smilefish, I worked on a client's website, Seanet, which allowed people to time-share privately owned boats. I applied my new React knowledge to enhance functionality and design:

- Added **sorting features** for improved user navigation.
- Updated the website’s design, contributing to an intuitive user interface.
- Abstracted features into new, reusable components, improving the project’s scalability.
- Learned to integrate **server requests**, deepening my backend knowledge.

This project also taught me how to collaborate on existing codebases, a vital skill for any software engineer.

## AWS: Expanding My Cloud Computing Knowledge

To complement my web development skills, I pursued AWS Partner Accreditations. These certifications equipped me with:

- A comprehensive understanding of cloud computing principles.
- Practical knowledge of how AWS services can support diverse project needs.
- Both business and technical perspectives on AWS tools, bridging the gap between development and strategy.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages:** JavaScript
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React
- **Platforms:** AWS
- **Tools:** Git, Udemy

## Takeaways

My time at Smilefish was an invaluable learning experience. It allowed me to:

- Expand my technical skill set in React and AWS.
- Gain hands-on experience with collaborative software development.
- Apply newly acquired skills to real-world projects.
